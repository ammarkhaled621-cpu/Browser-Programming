# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Linked an external CSS file to my portfolio website
- Improved typography for better readability
- Added spacing using margin and padding
- Styled the header and footer with background color and padding
- Converted a list into a horizontal navigation menu
- Made images responsive so they do not overflow
- Centered the content and limited the page width

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- Element selector (body, h1, h2, section)
- Group selector (header, footer)
- Descendant selector (nav a)
- Class selector (.card)
- ID selector (#portfolio, #contact)
- Pseudo-class selector (nav a:hover)

## One thing I struggled with
- Understanding the difference between margin and padding and when to use each one

## One improvement I want to do next
- Improve the visual design with better colors and layout sections
