# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
I created a semantically structured portfolio page using proper HTML5 elements including header, sections, figures, and footer.

## 2. Semantic decisions I made

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: Top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct: It introduces the page and contains my main heading and personal information.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<section>` and `<figure>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio/Works area
- Why this element is semantically correct: `<section>` groups related content and `<figure>` is used for images and media with captions.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<footer>`
- Where in the page: Bottom of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct: It contains contact and social links related to the page author.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- I added a skip link to allow keyboard users to jump to the main content.
- I used alt text for all images to help screen reader users.
- I followed a proper heading hierarchy to improve navigation.

## 4. What I learned
I learned how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements instead of generic divs.

## 5. What I still need to improve
I want to improve how I structure complex layouts semantically.

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is: Basic semantic structure
- What I modified manually: Personal content and links
